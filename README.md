# Prism Mart

'Prism Mart' is an ecommerce app developed using Android 
Studio and Firebase. There are two segments. Customer and administrative segment. A store owner who has this role can use the app to manage several aspects of their business, including orders, sales track, and product information (by uploading new products, deleting existing ones, or updating existing ones). On the other side, a person can register as a customer and login to the app using the proper credentials. A customer can search for a certain product, add it to their cart. When placing a order, he or she can add their address through Google Maps.Through the myorder page, a customer can view all of his prior orders. The setting page allows both the admin and the customer to change their login credentials and other information. There is a password reset option in the sign in page  if the user forgets their password.
 All of the information about the user, the product, the order, and the cart is handled using the Firebase database.
